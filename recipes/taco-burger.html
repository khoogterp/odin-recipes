  <h3>What You Need</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ground Beef | 1 lbs</li>
    <li>Corn Tortilla (or Tortilla of choice) | 6-10</li>
    <li>Salt (Any other seasonings you may want) | To Taste</li>
    <li>Cheese of Choice | 6-10 Slices</li>
    <li>Toppings and Condiments of Choice</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What To Know</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You can use any kind of tortilla you'd like but I'd stick to the smaller size "street taco" tortilla
      shells because it makes working with and cooking the ground beef much easier.
    </li>
    <li>
      I like to use mainly salt to season my meat but occasionally I'll add some things like
      Lawry's Seasoning or just some basic garlic and onion powder!
    </li>
    <li>
      I love cheese! I use two slices of Pepper Jack cheese but if I'm not in the mood for spicy food then
      I like the classic chedder or even some swiss cheese, Yum!
    </li>
    <li>
      The trick is to treat it like it's a normal burger, but don't be afraid to get creative and dice up some
      jalepenos or even a little fresh cilantro! Typically I enjoy these with the classic lettuce, pickles, 
      onions and ketchup but build these however you'd like!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What To Do</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The First step is to thaw your ground beef. Overnight in the fridge is the best way but if you are in a
      pinch and need results now, then the microwave can be helpful. Just be careful, it likes to start cooking
      the meat if you leave it in for too long.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once your ground beef is no longer frozen you can make a small ball of meat, about 1-2 inches in diameter
      and then begin smashing the ground beef onto one side of the tortilla. The key to this step is to smash
      it as thin as you can and covering the entire torilla shell. Typically the patty will shrink in size
      slightly so you can make the patties a little bit bigger than the tortilla shells. Add and remove meat
      as neccessary and dont forget to season the exposed side of the beef!
    </li>
    <li>
      Put a pan or iron skillet on medium-high heat and allow it to warm up. Once it's hot you can put the 
      taco smash burger <strong>meat</strong> side down (don't forget to season!). 
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow it to cook for 4-10 minutes depending on how well done you'd like it and flip for 1-2 minutes or
      or until the tortilla starts to brown. It doesn't take long for the torilla to finish so if your meat
      isn't cooked to your liking I'd flip it back over and finish cooking the meat first.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once your meat and tortilla is cooked to your liking you can quickly add a slice of cheese to it, either
      while they are still on the pan/skillet or once they are off the heat. I like to cook the tortilla so
      that it's a little crispy and then remove the taco smash burger from the heat and add my cheese then.
    </li>
    <li>
      From here you can start adding any toppings or condiments that you may like! This is where the fun
      begins! Like I said earlier, get creative! You can totally make an actual "taco" taco smash burger 
      if you know what I mean! The important part is to make it however you like it!
    </li>
    <li>All that's left is to do is fold it in half like a taco and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
