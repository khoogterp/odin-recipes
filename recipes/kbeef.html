  <h2>My Favorite Meal!</h2>
    <p>
      This is the easiest recipe I know and it's also one of my favorite meals! It's only a handful of 
      ingredients and it's quick to make with an even quicker cleanup! This recipe is for 1 lb of meat but 
      you can easily scale it to fit however many people you need to feed! I've seen korean BBQ beef made in 
      a crockpot with 3 pounds of meat so you can get creative with the way you make it, afterall it's pretty 
      much just sauce and meat! However,  I like the tried and true method of the oven! Nothing special but it
      certainly does the trick.

    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shaved Beef/ steak  |  1 lbs</li>
        <li>Korean BBQ Sauce  |  1/2 Jar</li>
        <li>White Rice  |  3 cups uncooked rice along with 4 cups of water</li> 
        <li>Broccoli (Optional) |  2-4 Florets</li>
        <li>Crushed Red Pepper  |  Add to taste if you want some spice</li>
        <li>Green Onions  |  For garnishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What To Know</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I like to use shaved ribeye but any shaved steak or beef will do. The thinner the better!</li>
        <li>You can find homemade korean BBQ sauce recipes online and they are all good and for the most part
          really simple! However I like to use the pre-made sauce for a quick and easy meal!</li>
        <li>I like to switch up the veggies from time to time, in fact some times I'll skip them all together!
          The frozen stir fry veggie mixs are quick and easy but most of the time I steam a little broccoli
          and add that in.</li>
        <li>If you have a taste for spice you can add some crushed red pepper or you can add some spice in with
          the sauce like gochujang or even some spicy korean BBQ sauces.</li>
        <li>The green onions are not needed but they add a great bit of flavor as well as a nice look.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What To Do</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First lets prep the meat! Put your meat into a large ziploc bag or any sealed container and pour
          your sauce into it. Mix well and let it marinate in the fridge. 15-30 minutes is more than enough for
          the thinly sliced meat to abosrb some of the sauce but you can marinate overnight if you'd like! This
          is also where you can add some crushed red pepper or any form of spice of your choice!</li>
        <li>Next you need to bring 4 cups of water to boil and then stir in the 3 cups of uncooked rice. You
          can also go ahead and pre-heat your oven for 400&deg; F. </li>
        <li>After stirring in your rice, reduce heat, cover it and let it cook for 11-18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now you can add your marinated meat to a large cooking tray (use alunimun foil for an even easier
          cleanup!) and spread it out evenly so that it's not overlapping or clumped up too much.</li>
        <li>Once your oven is pre-heated you can go ahead and put your meat into the oven and let it cook for
          9-14 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now that the rice and meat are cooking for ~10 minutes you can steam your veggies. I like to use
          the microwave for the fastest results. Once the veggies are ready you can set them aside for later.</li>
        <li>If you have time you can quickly dice up some green onions and set those aside as well.</li>
        <li>Once your rice looks finished, you can stir it around to fluff it and release some of the trapped
          steam and then set aside to be served.</li>
        <li>Once the meat turns brown and is cooked to your liking you can take it out and let is rest for
          ~5 minutes. This allows the sauce to settle and mix well with the meat.</li>
        <li>Once everything is done resting you can begin mixing your meat and veggies in a large bowl or
          conatainer. Make sure to get all the sauce from the tray!</li>
        <li>And that's pretty much it! you can plate it with some rice and top it off with a little green 
          onion and viola! a quick and delicous meal!</li>
    </ol>
